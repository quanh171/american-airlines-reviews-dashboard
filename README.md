## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **customer reviews for American Airlines** to uncover patterns in passenger satisfaction. The goal was to identify what service factors influence customer perception, and how different traveler and seat types experience the airline.

The work was done using **Excel and SQL (MySQL)** for data preparation and **Tableau** for visualization.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared review data (handling nulls, standardizing column names).
- Built **SQL queries** to calculate overall satisfaction and pairwise Pearson correlations across service factors.
- Created a **Tableau dashboard** including:
  - KPIs (Overall Rating, % Recommended, # of Reviews, Verified %)
  - Service Experience Metrics
  - Time Series Analysis of reviews & satisfaction
  - Customer demographics (traveler type, seat type, nationality)
  - Correlation heatmap of service dimensions (Economy vs Non-Economy)

---

## üîç How I Did It
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Source: `FCT_REVIEW` and `DIM_CUSTOMER` tables.
   - Cleaned data, changed incorrect data types, and applied null values into empty cells to minimize chance of running into errors.
   - Ratings treated as 1‚Äì5 scale (1 = poor, 5 = excellent).
   - Created sub-tables for future uses.

2. **Correlation Matrix**
   - Applied filters to exclude null values.
   - Implemented Pearson correlation using SQL.
   - Segmented by Economy vs Non-Economy seats.
   - Exported results into Tableau as a highlight table heatmap.

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - KPI summary at the top for quick health check.
   - Trend lines to show long-term patterns.
   - Pie/Bar charts for demographic breakdowns.
   - Heatmaps for deep-dive into service relationships.

## üîç Key Insights
- **Low satisfaction overall**: Average rating **1.9/5**, with only **12.5% recommending**.
- **Economy class dominates reviews (84%) but underperforms** across all metrics.
- **Ground Service (1.7) and WiFi (1.7)** are the weakest areas.
- **Value for Money** is most influenced by **Seat Comfort** and **Food & Beverages** (strong correlations).
- **Non-Economy travelers** enjoy more consistent service experiences.
- **Recent trend**: Recommendation rate shows slight recovery in 2024‚Äì2025.

---

## üí° Recommendations
- Make satisfaction **a top KPI**; set improvement targets (e.g., double recommendation rate in 2 years).
- Focus upgrades on **seat comfort, food quality, and cleanliness** in Economy to raise overall scores.
- Improve **boarding/check-in efficiency and WiFi reliability** (or set clearer expectations).
- Small, visible improvements in these areas will boost **perceived value**.
- Market premium cabins as reliable, while **closing the gap in Economy** to lift the brand overall.
- Build momentum with **loyalty perks**, **customer guarantees**, **or service pilots**, and track progress monthly.

## ‚úÖ What Worked Well
- Successfully created a **correlation heatmap** in SQL + Tableau.
- Dashboard gives both **high-level KPIs** and **deep-dive analytics**.
- Combining **traveler profile + service ratings** provided clear context.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Didn‚Äôt Work / Limitations
- Lack of **detailed nationality data** (beyond country count).
- Some **review text (qualitative data)** wasn‚Äôt analyzed ‚Äî could add sentiment analysis.

---

## üéì What I Learned
- Practical use of **Pearson correlation in SQL** for survey-like data.
- How to design a **storytelling Tableau dashboard** that mixes KPIs, demographics, and statistical analysis.
- Importance of **joining Tableau extracts with SQL results** using a dummy join key.

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add **sentiment analysis** on review text (using NLP).
- Automate **correlation recalculation in Tableau** using calculated fields or parameterized SQL.
- Include **benchmarking against other airlines** for context.
- Add **predictive modeling** (e.g., logistic regression) to estimate probability of recommendation.
